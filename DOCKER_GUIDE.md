2. **Open terminal in project folder**
3. **Run one command:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
## What Happens
- Backend starts on port 5000
- Frontend starts on port 3000
- Everything is connected automatically

## Access the App
Open your browser to for client instance: **http://localhost:3000**

## To Stop
Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal

- Run `docker-compose down` to clean up if needed

That's it! ðŸŽ‰
